# Java-JDBC

7 steps in connecting Java with DataBase are as follows :-

1.Import the package
2.a)Load the driver
  b)Register the driver
3.Establish the connection with database
4.Create a Statement
5.Exceute the query
6.Process the result
7.Close the connection and statement

Creating a simple database in MySQL and accessing the content of that database through Java JDBC.

NOTE :- In 2a step you need to explicitly load the driver if you are using Eclipse IDE by downloading the MySQL driver from mvnrepository ( https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mysql/mysql-connector-j/8.0.33 ) and then adding the downloaded JAR file using Build Path.
